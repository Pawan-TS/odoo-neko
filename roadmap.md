# SynergySphere Roadmap

## MVP Scope

**Core Features:**
1. **User Authentication:** Register, login, logout, basic profile.
2. **Project Management:** Create, view, and manage projects.
3. **Team Management:** Add/remove team members to projects.
4. **Task Management:** Create, assign, update, and track tasks (with status and due dates).
5. **Project Discussions:** Threaded chat/comments per project.
6. **Notifications:** Basic alerts for new tasks, status changes, mentions, etc.
7. **Responsive UI:** Works well on both desktop and mobile.

---

## How to Build It (Tech Stack & Approach)

**Frontend:**
- Use **React** (with React Native for mobile, or just responsive web with React + CSS frameworks like Tailwind/Bootstrap).
- Use **Redux** or Context API for state management.
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop.

**Backend:**
- Use **Node.js** (Express) or **Django**/**Flask** for REST APIs.
- Store data in **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**.
- Use **JWT** for authentication.

**Real-time Features:**
- Use **Socket.io** (Node) or Django Channels for real-time chat/notifications.

**Deployment:**
- Host on **Vercel/Netlify** (frontend) and **Render/Heroku** (backend).
- Use **Firebase** for notifications (optional).

## Unique/Crazy Feature Ideas

1. **AI-Powered Task Suggestions:**  
   Suggest breaking down large tasks, or auto-assign based on workload/history.

2. **Smart Workload Balancer:**  
   Visualize team member workloads and suggest reassignments to avoid burnout.

3. **Proactive Deadline Alerts:**  
   Predict and warn about likely missed deadlines using task progress and team activity.

4. **Integrated Voice Notes:**  
   Allow users to leave quick voice messages in project discussions or tasks.

5. **Mood/Team Pulse Check:**  
   Quick emoji or slider for team members to share how they’re feeling about workload or project health.

6. **Automatic Meeting Summaries:**  
   If you add a meeting/chat feature, use AI to summarize discussions and action items.

7. **Task Dependency Visualization:**  
   Show which tasks block others, and alert when a blocker is resolved.

8. **One-Click Standup:**  
   Each user can submit a quick daily update (what they did, blockers, plans) that’s visible to the team.

9. **Tunnels (AI-Powered Idea Linking):**  
   Automatically discover and visualize connections between related tasks, discussions, documents, and ideas across the platform. Inspired by Obsidian's linking, but powered by AI (using cosine similarity, embeddings, and other matching techniques), this feature creates "tunnels"—contextual links—between similar or relevant items, helping users navigate knowledge, spot patterns, and surface hidden relationships without manual tagging. Users can explore these tunnels to see how different parts of their work are interconnected, boosting insight and collaboration.

## Example User Flow

1. **User signs up/logs in.**
2. **Creates a project** and invites team members.
3. **Adds tasks**, assigns them, sets due dates.
4. **Team members update task status** as they work.
5. **Project chat** for discussions.
6. **Notifications** for new tasks, mentions, or status changes.
7. **Dashboard** shows project/task progress and team workload.

## Next Steps

- **Sketch wireframes** (use Figma or pen & paper).
- **Set up your backend and database.**
- **Build the frontend screens** (start with login, dashboard, project, task, chat).
- **Add real-time chat/notifications.**
- **Polish UI for mobile/desktop.**
- **(Optional) Add unique features** as time allows.
